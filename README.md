FinVisor AI: Your Personal Finance & Investment Coach
Submission for [Phantom Agents]

The Problem
Financial planning is complex and intimidating for many. People struggle to track their spending, understand their financial health, and often miss out on savings, tax, and investment opportunities 
because professional advice is expensive and inaccessible.

Our Solution
FinVisor AI is a smart, full-stack web application that acts as a personal financial coach, available 24/7. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide personalized, actionable financial advice based on a user's real income and expenses.

We don't just track numbers; we provide intelligent insights to help users improve their financial future.

 Key Features & Innovation
Dynamic Financial Dashboard: A real-time, interactive dashboard built with React and Recharts to visualize the user's financial health, including income, expenses, and a categorized spending breakdown.

AI-Powered Insights Engine: The core of our hack. We use the Google Gemini AI to analyze the user's financial data and generate tailored advice across three critical areas:

Savings & Budgeting: Actionable tips to improve spending habits.

Tax Optimization: Clear, relevant advice on minimizing tax liability.

Investment Opportunities: Suggestions based on the user's savings potential.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Core AI Service: Google Gemini AI

Real-time Data API: Finnhub.io

Live Market Data Integration (Bonus Feature): To make the advice even more relevant, we integrated the Finnhub.io API. When available, the AI's investment suggestions adapt to real-time stock and ETF market data, providing timely and context-aware recommendations.

Hackathon Judging Criteria
Innovation & Creativity: We believe our use of a multi-source AI prompt (combining user data and real-time market data) is a highly innovative approach to personal finance.

Technical Achievement: This is a complete MERN stack application built from scratch during the hackathon, featuring secure authentication, a reactive frontend, and a complex, multi-API backend.

User Experience (UX): The dashboard is designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and, most importantly, instantly responsive to user actions.

Impact: FinVisor AI has the potential to democratize financial advice, making it accessible and understandable for everyone.

Secure & Scalable Backend: Built on a robust Node.js, Express, and MongoDB stack with secure JWT-based user authentication
